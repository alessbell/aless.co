I'm happy to share that I'm joining [Apollo GraphQL](http://apollographql.com) as a Senior Open Source Engineer working on the Apollo Client team, beginning today 🎉

[`@apollo/client`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) is the most widely used GraphQL client library on the web: thousands of engineers building high performance web apps rely on it to cache and manage data fetched from GraphQL APIs.

The team is incredibly talented and kind. This will be my first full-time role working in OSS, and the chance to collaborate with veteran open source leaders like [hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) and [benjamn](https://github.com/benjamn) is an opportunity I couldn't pass up. I'm so excited to get started.
