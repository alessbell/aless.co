2023 was an _intense_ and incredible year. I threw my hat in the ring and wound up speaking at six conferences on two continents. Carla, O and I traveled to new places including Boise, Idaho and (new-to-baby-O) London, England. I also found myself struggling to keep up with a growing list of responsibilities, or more accurately, I began ignoring the things that fuel and inspire me in favour of everything else on my plate.

But let's start at the beginning...

## January

The most notable thing that happened in January: baby O said "I love you" for the first time.
