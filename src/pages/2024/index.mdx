> Welcome to the sixth edition of my year in review. (See [2023](/2023), [2022](/2022), [2021](/2021), [2020](/2020) and [2019](/2019) for previous editions.)

2024 was a year of two beautiful babies born to two of my best friends: congratulations to their proud, wonderful parents, Robin and Mark and V√©ro and Geoff ‚ô•Ô∏è

It was also the year I became an American citizen, my two younger siblings graduated from law school, I rounded out the first decade of my career as a software engineer and O turned 3. We also discovered apartment swapping this year! We did two, one with M in Montreal and the other with a family of Js from Berlin, two big highlights.

Let's start at the beginning.

## See you never, USCIS

I came to the U.S. from Canada on a three year [dual intent](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-are-dual-intent-visas.html) work visa, an L1-B, in early 2017. I was working at a Canadian startup with a New York office and quite literally hit the ground running: I remember dashing out to pick up my new social security card emblazoned with the words `VALID FOR WORK ONLY WITH DHS AUTHORIZATION` followed by a new SIM card in Chinatown on one of my first mornings.

In my first few weeks in the city I went to a University of Toronto alumni event at a hotel by Central Park. I don't know what I was expecting: it was a ballroom full of Canadians drinking cocktails, discussing which visas they were on.

I lived in Williamsburg in a fourth floor walk-up with a roommate I found on Craigslist (shout out to Milo üíñ) and worked in SoHo. It feels silly in retrospect, but I was ***actually surprised*** at how much I loved living in New York, pretty much immediately.

When I had raised my hand for this opportunity, I wasn't thinking long-term: it seemed like a new and interesting challenge, one that would be **fun**. But once I arrived, I realized the three year clock on my visa was already ticking. I had to start lobbying my employer to sponsor my green card application if I had any interest in buying myself more time. I also met Carla soon after arriving and didn't want this new and clearly very special relationship cut short.

Thus began one of the most challenging periods of my life as I embarked on the journey from [nonresident alien](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/nonresident-aliens) to lawful permanent resident, and finally citizen in February of this year.

There's a lot more to say here and maybe I'll write about it in greater detail one day. But seeing the life and career I was building dangling by a thread as I navigated a dated, contrived process, without job portability, while working at a faltering startup, all __during a virulently anti-immigrant administration__‚Äî_not to mention the early pandemic_, which resulted in longer delays‚Äîwas so stressful it's hard to describe. For almost four years, I obsessively read immigration forums and shared application timelines with fellow travelers through the broken system that is the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. I felt totally powerless and dealt with depression and anxiety.

The people I could relate to most during this period were my grandparents. Speaking with them gave me comfort: they had immigrated to Canada from Italy in the 1950s with other close relatives ending up in the U.S., and they knew about the travel restrictions and missed life events that were part and parcel of this experience.

I'm relieved I‚Äîa Canadian with a degree, though not one relevant to the field I wound up in‚Äîcan finally put down my bags, but so many people are stuck with _far_ longer waits or without any path to legal status whatsoever. The scale of human suffering caused by a system we can and must fix is mind numbing; it urgently needs to change.

The last thing I'll add, in case it helps someone in the future, is how critical it is to consult a lawyer. But this is important: NOT the one your employer hires to work on your application. ___That is the company's lawyer.___ The best advice I received was from attorney [Jonathan Langer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanlanger); if you're ever in need of a U.S. immigration consult, I can't recommend him highly enough.

Anyways, I'm American now. üá∫üá∏ This is the place I call home, where I've started a family and plan to stay for the rest of my life‚Äîit still feels surreal to write those words.

## Lawyered up

In May, my younger siblings Martina and Luca graduated from University of Toronto and Osgoode Hall law schools respectively. So naturally I made them into bobbleheads.

Carla, O and I got to visit Toronto to celebrate with everyone‚Äîit was a joyous time. I assumed I'd be going to their grad ceremonies, but my brother informed me that tickets were in limited supply, the ones he had were set aside for our grandparents and his personal ethics prevented him from participating in the shadow market that had emerged.

I thought he was joking. He was not. So I accepted my fate and hung around in my pajamas watching everyone get ready... but those who know the Bellisarios know that math is ___not___ our strong suit. That day it was my saving grace: Luca had miscounted! I had a ticket after all! And about 10 minutes to get ready.

I remembered my camera and got to snap some photos like this one of our 96 year old grandfather, Aldo, beaming with pride:

## Thanks for the good times, Apollo

This past Friday was my last day at [Apollo](https://apollographql.com). I want to thank my colleagues who made the last 2.5 years as memorable as they were: [Jeff](https://bsky.app/profile/jeff.auriemma.xyz), [Hugh](https://github.com/hwillson), [Jerel](https://x.com/jerelmiller), [Lenz](https://bsky.app/profile/phry.dev) and [Ben](https://github.com/benjamn) especially, and my wider Clients Team family including [Martin](https://bsky.app/profile/mbonnin.net), [Benoit](https://mastodon.social/@BoD@mastodon.social), [Calvin](https://x.com/c35tar1), [Anthony](https://x.com/AnthonyMDev) and [Zach](https://github.com/BobaFetters).

It was nothing short of a dream job: I got to do open source work full-time with some of the brightest, most thoughtful engineers and managers in the world and travel around speaking about what we were building. I gave eight talks in two years (ok, with some recycled material üòÖ) at some of the biggest React and GraphQL conferences around the globe. My face was even in the (in)famous React Conf 2024 grid:

It has been such a distinct pleasure working with everyone at Apollo, and I've learned so many things from this experience I'll carry forward in my career. The future is incredibly bright for Apollo and the GraphQL community writ large.

## Tudum

One last bit of news: today is my first day as a Senior Software Engineer at Netflix! I'll be working on the XD Design Engineering team building the Design Platform API with some incredible colleagues, and I couldn't be more excited about it.


- April: Cape Cod visit
- June: Toronto (sibling hang!) and Montreal for Carla's 40th bday
- July: Hudson Valley and Buffalo
- August: Orlando turns 3; Germany!!!
