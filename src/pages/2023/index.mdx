2023 was both an intense and wonderful year. Baby O turned 2! I threw my hat in the ring and had the opportunity to speak at six conferences on two continents. Carla, Baby O and I traveled to new places including St. John's, Newfoundland, Boise, Idaho and (new to the little one) London and Paris. I also found myself struggling to keep up with a growing list of responsibilities, or said a different way, I began ignoring the things that fuel and inspire me in favour of everything else on my plate.

## January

The most notable thing that happened in January: Baby O said "I love you" for the first time. I've never managed to journal consistently, but whenever a "first" happens _and I remember to pull out my phone_, I add it as a simple calendar event.

A quick search cues up a heartwarming and comical set of memories: the first time he used a spoon by himself; the first time he slept in a big kid bed (he transitioned from a crib at 18 months for safety reasons - do __not__ recommend if you can help it ðŸ¥²); the first time he demanded toys in a toy store (I remember it well...).

## March: Brooklyn rendezvous

A friend of mine was engaged to be married in the summer and her bachlorette party was set for Brooklyn.

As the resident New Yorker, I put together a list of dinner spots and activities. Spending time with seven of my dearest, oldest friends in my city is something I'll never forget.

## June: another canuck in the house ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

In June Baby O had his Canadian citizenship recognized, coincidentally on my grandfather's 95th birthday. As the legal child of a Canadian he's been Canadian since birth, but making it official was an important milestone. I was able to file online using a new process they've rolled out recentlyâ€”the artifact at the end is a simple PDF.

The hardest part was taking a photo that met the Canadian requirements, not easily done in the US. (We just waited for an upcoming Toronto trip and had them taken at a Shoppers, highly recommend.) Our appetite for bureaucratic paperwork still not fully sated, we then applied for his NEXUS card. It's not widely known, but NEXUS is a superset of the Global Entry program (!). Soooo worth it.

## Also June: finding a therapist



## July: heading east

I've long kept a bucket list like every good Millennial, and Newfoundland has been on it almost from the beginning. Years ago, I dated someone who moved to Halifax in the course of our relationship and I got to know lots of Maritimers through my visits.

If you're thinking "but Alessia, Newfoundland isn't part of [the Maritimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maritimes)!" there is an 80% chance you are from Newfoundland. (Does _anyone_ know this outside the region? I learned it while surfing the St. John's subreddit for toddler activities and watching unsuspecting people get roasted.) Now, dear reader, you too know this bit of Canadian arcana: Atlantic Canada is the Maritimes plus Newfoundland.

I digress. The plan was to fly into St. John's, do the St. John's folk music festival and travel around a bit. Bopping around with a toddler we didn't push ourselves, but we saw some gorgeous nature, met lovely people including Marnie, the owner of children's book publisher and store [Running the Goat](https://runningthegoat.com/) in Tors Cove, had amazing dinners and the biggest, most perfectly cooked piece of haddock at [Portage](https://www.portagenl.ca/). I'd love to visit more remote parts of the province and see Gros Morne one day.

The music festival was also a ton of fun: Baby O ran up and down the aisles during the sets and pretended he didn't know us out of fear we'd cramp his style.
