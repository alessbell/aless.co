It started three years ago. A friend and coworker turned heads when he came to work one day with a mechanical keyboard. If memory serves, it was a standard 87-key tenkeyless layout with Cherry MX Blue switches, but all anyone noticed were the keycaps.

I was happily a standard issue MacBook keyboard user at the time (pre-2015 redesign, RIP). I'd never typed on let alone read a spec sheet for a mechanical keyboard. Josh and I sat beside each other, so I was the first to ask him the question I'd later hear him field a few times a week: _...but where are the letters?_

Josh had chosen a flashy pattern of multicolored, and crucially, _blank_ keycaps. Something about them was both endearing and an affront. They said "I'm a confident touch typer who is making an aesthetic choice," and also "if you're not in the club, I am the functional equivalent of a gilded tray of marbles." I was mystified. I needed to know more.

## WASD

I tried out Josh's keyboard a couple of times while pairing, researched for the better part of a year and finally got myself the WASD 87-key v2, also with blank keycaps, though I went with the slightly quieter but still satisfyingly tacticle bump-y MX Cherry Brown switches. I was a fast and confident typist, but still I hedged: I got my initials in highlighter yellow as a visual anchor.

I loved it and used it every day for about a year and a half. But as soon as I started learning more about keyboards, I read about boards that aren't available off the shelf, ones you need to assemble yourself...
