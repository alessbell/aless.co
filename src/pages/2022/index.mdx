Hello again! I can hardly believe I'm back at my laptop typing up another Year in Review post. Let's go...

## 2022 was a year of:

- two sweet babies born to friends and family (Adriano and Vivian üíõüíú)
- one lemon-and-soccer-themed 1st birthday for Baby O ‚öΩÔ∏è
- one 60th birthday celebration ft. pizza, sushi and my amazing mom, Erica
- one 60th birthday bash that involved a surprising (or unsurprising, if you know my dad) number of cartwheels: HBD "G Money" aka my uncle Gino
- three beautiful weddings in Boston, Muskoka and the Bahamas (V√©ro & Geoff, Karyn & Cam and Andrew & Naz üéâ)

At the close of 2021, Baby O was just four and a half months old and Carla and I were still getting our sea legs as parents. Through the haze of the first few months, we couldn't have been happier to be new moms to someone we already sensed was a very happy and **_energetic_** kid.

## By the power vested in me by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

In February, I had the singular honour of marrying two of my best friends in Boston, V√©ronique and Geoff. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to tick the bureaucratic boxes needed to legally officiate a wedding in Massachussetts.

There was a cold snap and a furry convention at the hotel next door. 

## Meeting the family

For 10 days in June and July, Carla, Baby O and I descended on the Bay Area to visit dear friends of mine: Robin makes a mean martini, [gorgeous pottery and ceramics](https://www.robinbceramics.com/) and is a [brilliant historian](https://ucberkeley.academia.edu/RobinBuller); her husband Mark is a gardening guru who also tends cells in his day job genetically engineering delicious and sustainable [lab-grown meat](https://upsidefoods.com/).

But there was another important reason we took our 10 month old on a cross-country plane ride: to meet some of his siblings for the first time üíñ

In the world of donor conception, Carla and I have learned about the importance of bio kin from hearing the stories of adult donor conceived people (DCP). While some recipient parents (RPs) use the term "diblings" (for "donor siblings"), we've realized that can downplay the bond our son has with the people who share 50% of his DNA. After all, plenty of kids are raised in blended families with biological half siblings, but no one corrects them when they refer to their siblings as such.
