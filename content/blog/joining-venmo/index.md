The last time I started a new job, I couldn't have imagined what it would have in store for me. I was joining [Breather](https://breather.com) in MontrÃ©al which involved a winter move from my home in Toronto. Arriving January 2, 2015 with two suitcases, I had no idea the coldest February in the city's recorded history was awaiting me the following month.

I lived in a spacious studio with crooked door frames on Avenue du Parc--an apartment that would later seem palatial by New York City standards--and, for the first few months, spent my evenings and weekends inside during bouts of -40Â°C temps, pouring over books like [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).

I had decided to move after only a single day of on-site interviews spent at the Breather office in the Mile End: I'd seen the airport, the view from the city bus from the airport, the subway from downtown to Rosemont station and the few blocks I'd walked from the subway to Breather's bright and airy office. I didn't know a single person but for the small and friendly team of coworkers I would slowly get to know.

Before Breather, I was working a job at an agency in Toronto, one I felt lucky to have been offered after two short stints at small startups right out of the full-stack bootcamp I attended in 2014.

Talk about then-manager Ashish taking me out for coffee and encouraging me to stick to engineering companies.
