import { ArticleLayout } from '@/components/ArticleLayout'

export const meta = {
  author: 'Alessia Bellisario',

  title: 'Release Automation in @apollo/client',
  // description: '',
}

export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

This post is about the steps I took to automate `@apollo/client`'s release process; hopefully it will save someone else a few minutes in the future who may be considering a similar workflow :)

## Changesets

After looking at a few alternatives, [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) was clearly the library that would allow our team building `@apollo/client` to adapt our existing manual workflow in the most seamless way.

It has an API for prereleases involving long-running integration branches we'll explore later on, allows changelog entries to be authored (and _edited_) in markdown which are written at the time the relevant code is committed, and gives maintainers the right granularity of control over the way changesets are batched.

IMO, the prerelease workflow is the more interesting of the two to discuss since its API is still somewhat in development, so let's take a look at the release workflow first.
