> Slow comes the hour, its passing speed how great!

Hello again! I can hardly believe I'm back at my laptop typing up another Year in Review post. Here we go again...

2022 was a year of:
- two sweet babies born to friends and family (Adriano and Vivian ðŸ’›ðŸ’œ)
- one lemon-and-soccer-themed 1st birthday for Baby O
- one 60th birthday celebration ft. pizza, sushi and my wonderful mom, Erica
- one 60th birthday bash that involved a surprising (or unsurprising, if you know my dad) number of cartwheels: HBD "G Money" aka my uncle Gino
- three beautiful weddings in Boston, Muskoka and the Bahamas (VÃ©ro & Geoff, Karyn & Cam and Andrew & Naz ðŸŽ‰)

At the close of 2021, Baby O was just four and a half months old and Carla and I were still getting our sea legs as parents. Through the haze of a sleepless first few months, we couldn't have been happier to be new moms to someone we could already tell was a very happy and ***energetic*** kid.

## By the power vested in me by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

In February, I had the honour of marrying two of my best friends in Boston, VÃ©ronique and Geoff.
