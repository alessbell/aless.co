Hello again! I can hardly believe I'm back at my laptop typing up another Year in Review post! Let's go 🏃‍♀️ 

## 2022 was a year of:

- two sweet babies born to friends and family (Adriano and Vivian 💛💜)
- one lemon-and-soccer-themed 1st birthday for Baby O ⚽️
- one 60th birthday celebration ft. pizza, sushi and my amazing mom, Erica
- one 60th birthday bash that involved a surprising (or unsurprising, if you know my dad) number of cartwheels: HBD "G Money" aka my uncle Gino
- one 70th birthday weekend for the books celebrating my father-in-law, John
- four beautiful weddings in Boston, Muskoka, Salt Lake City and the Bahamas (Véro & Geoff, Karyn & Cam, James & Germaine and Andrew & Naz 🎉)

At the close of 2021, Baby O was just four and a half months old and Carla and I were still getting our sea legs as parents. Through the haze of the first few months, we couldn't have been happier to be new moms to someone we already sensed was a very happy, goofy and **_energetic_** kid.

In February, I had the honour of marrying two of my best friends in Boston, Véronique and Geoff. I was pleasantly surprised by how simple it was to tick the bureaucratic boxes required to legally officiate a wedding in Massachussetts.

## Meeting the family

For ten days in June and July, Carla, Baby O and I descended on the Bay Area to visit dear friends of mine: Robin is a [brilliant historian](https://ucberkeley.academia.edu/RobinBuller) who makes a mean martini and [gorgeous pottery and ceramics](https://www.robinbceramics.com/); Mark, Robin's husband, is an excellent gardener who tends cells in his day job genetically engineering sustainable and delicious [lab-grown meat](https://upsidefoods.com/).

But there was another important reason we took our 10 month old on his first cross-country plane ride: to meet some of his siblings for the first time 💖 Carla and I have come to understand the importance of bio kin on Baby O's dad's side from listening to the perspectives of adult donor conceived people (DCP).

> While some use the term "diblings" (portmanteau of "donor siblings") to describe these sibling relationships, we've realized the term can downplay the connection our son has with the people who share 50% of his DNA. After all, lots of (non-DCP) kids grow up knowing their biological half siblings, but no one corrects them when they refer to their siblings without qualification.

Meeting some of his siblings and their families for the first time was an incredible experience: the kids are all happy and outgoing, and while they're being raised in different households, it was amazing to observe the traits they share, even at such a young age. When the youngest sibling present began to cry, every parent in the room perked up. It sounded remarkably like each of our kids.

A huge added bonus for Carla and I was getting to know the parents. I've heard the term "cross-mom" used by DCP to refer to your sibling's mom, for example. Well, Baby O has lots of cross-moms and non-binary cross-parents! We're biased, but it's a super cool group of parents and kids, to a person.
