> Welcome to the sixth edition of my year in review. (See [2023](/2023), [2022](/2022), [2021](/2021), [2020](/2020) and [2019](/2019) for previous editions.)

2024 was a year of two beautiful babies born to two of my best friends: congratulations to their proud parents, Robin and Mark and Véro and Geoff ♥️

It was also the year I became an American citizen, my two younger siblings graduated from law school and O turned 3. We also discovered apartment swapping this year: we did two, one with M in Montreal and the other with a family of Js from Berlin, two big highlights.

## See you never, USCIS

I came to the U.S. from Canada on a three year work visa—an L1-B for the immigrants—in 2017. I was working at a Canadian startup with a New York office and quite literally hit the ground running when I arrived. I remember dashing out to pick up both my new social security card emblazoned with the words "VALID FOR WORK ONLY WITH DHS AUTHORIZATION" followed by a SIM card in Chinatown on one of my first mornings.

I lived in Williamsburg in a small fourth floor walk-up with a roommate I found on Craigslist, worked in SoHo and absolutely loved it. When I raised my hand for this opportunity, I wasn't thinking long-term: it seemed like a new and interesting challenge, one that would be **fun**.

Once I arrived, it hit me that my three year clock was already ticking. I had to start lobbying the company to petition for my green card if I had any desire to buy myself more time in the city I was beginning to love.
